# Litex SOC with Advanced Interrupt Architecture

## Introduction

By integrating RISC-V Advanced Interrupt Architecture (AIA) support into the LiteX SoC framework, we aim to enhance LiteX with modern interrupt handling capabilities that support message-signaled interrupts (MSIs), virtualization, and improved scalability for multi-core systems.

## Background

The RISC-V Advanced Interrupt Architecture (AIA) represents the next generation of interrupt handling for RISC-V systems, offering significant advantages over traditional interrupt controllers:

- **Message-Signaled Interrupts (MSIs)**: Direct support for PCIe and other modern peripheral standards
- **Virtualization Support**: Hardware-assisted interrupt virtualization for guest VMs
- **Scalability**: Support for up to 16,384 harts with thousands of interrupt sources
- **Flexible Priority Management**: Software-configurable interrupt priorities across all interrupt types
- **Improved Latency**: Hardware acceleration for interrupt delivery and handling


### AIA vs CLIC Feature Comparison

| Feature | CLIC | AIA |
|---------|------|-----|
| Interrupt Sources | Up to 4096 | Up to 2047 per IMSIC |
| Priority Levels | 256 levels | Configurable priorities |
| Hardware Vectoring | Selective | Via IMSIC |
| MSI Support | No | Native |
| Virtualization | Limited | Full support |
| Multi-core Scaling | Limited | Up to 16,384 harts |
| Preemption | Level-based | Priority-based |
| Software Complexity | Lower | Higher |
| Hardware Complexity | Lower | Higher |
| Industry Adoption | Growing | Standardized |

### Implementation Complexity Analysis

#### CLIC Implementation
- **Advantages**: Simpler hardware, lower latency for real-time
- **Disadvantages**: No MSI support, limited virtualization

#### AIA Implementation
- **Advantages**: Future-proof, comprehensive feature set
- **Disadvantages**: Higher complexity, more resources
